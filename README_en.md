# A Library Management Program Written In C

This is a training assignment for the first semester of my freshman year, a library management program written in C language. The program allows users to add books, borrow books, return books, search for books, compensate for lost books, and query borrowed book records. Some functions only support compiling and running under Windows.

The main function of the program is located in the main.c file.
